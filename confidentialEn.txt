Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

HabitsTracker respects your privacy.

1) Data you create in the app
Your habits, completion history, and reminder settings are stored locally on your device (Core Data). We do not require an account.

2) Analytics
We use AppMetrica to improve the stability and functionality of the app. AppMetrica may collect technical information and diagnostics (such as device type, OS version, app version, and crash/performance data). This information helps us understand and fix issues and improve the app.

3) Notifications
The app uses local notifications to remind you about habits. Notification permissions are managed by iOS settings.

4) Import/Export
If you export data, a file is created on your device and shared only when you choose to do so.

5) Data deletion
You can delete habits inside the app. Removing the app from your device removes locally stored data.

6) Contact
If you have questions, contact us: habitstracker@yandex.ru
